# eduMeet in docker container

Docker hub repository: [edumeet/edumeet](https://hub.docker.com/r/edumeet/edumeet)

This is the container, or a "dockerized" version of the [eduMeet](https://github.com/edumeet/edumeet).
(Successor of [multiparty meeting](https://github.com/havfo/multiparty-meeting) fork of mediasoup-demo)

## Run it in few easy step

1. Git clone this code to your docker machine.

2. Run once `update-config.sh` which will download current `app` and `server` `config.example.js` files from main edumeet repository.
    - if there are no existing config.js files, script will automatically generate them

3. Run once `gen-redis-password.sh` to generate a random password for redis
    - only on the first run, generated password will be automatically set in both redis.conf and edumeet config.yaml files

4. Copy certificate and key files in `configs/certs/cert.pem` and `configs/certs/privkey.pem`
    - to generate a new (unsigned) certificate and private key, use: (note -nodes flag, which allows to generate unencrypted private key)

```sh
        $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```
5. edit config.yaml
    - this options has to be set in configs/server/config.yaml:

```yaml
      listeningPort: 443
      listeningHost: HOST.DOMAIN.TLD

      tls:
        cert : /opt/edumeet/server/certs/cert.pem
        key  : /opt/edumeet/server/certs/privkey.pem

      redisOptions:
        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: 6379
        password: _GENERATED_REDIS_PASSWORD_
```

- HOST.DOMAIN.TLD has to be replaced by server's IP or FQDN
- _GENERATED_REDIS_PASSWORD_ will be replaced automatically during step 3

**Recommended:**
- set TURN server and credential in `configs/server/config.yaml`
- in case of using coturn, generate a user and key with

```sh
        $ turnadmin -k -u <username> -p <password>
```
Placeholder looks like:

```yaml
        turnAPIURI: "https://HOST.DOMAIN.TLD/turn"
        turnAPIKey: "Your API key"

        backupTurnServers:
        - urls:
          - "turn:HOST.DOMAIN.TLD:443?transport=tcp"
          username: "username"
          credential: "credential"
```

- HOST.DOMAIN.TLD has to be replaced by server's IP or FQDN
- "username" is previously used `<username>`, and "credential" is the code generated by the above mentioned command.

**Optional:**
- replace logo/logo.svg with your company logo svg.
- sort audio/video codecs according to preference.

## Run

Run with `docker-compose` 
/ [install docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) /

```sh
  $ sudo docker-compose up --detach
```
- edumeet and redis images will be pooled from Docker hub
- **note**: to enable automatic Docker images update, uncomment `ouroboros` configuration in `docker-compose.yml`

## Rebuild

To rebuild edumeet docker image (eg. change in .env) use following command:

```sh
  $ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build
```

## Docker networking

Container works in "host" network mode, because bridge mode has the following issue
